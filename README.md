# Goal
A uniform performant scripting language for use inside any drone or GCSes.

# Uses
FIXME

# Adapter API
A given vehicle/GCS platform must implement an 'adapter' so flsq can run in that environment.

# Design notes

## Mavlink autogenerated code
Mavlink accessor classes are automatically generated from the message
definition XML.  Unfortunately for most vehicles these generated files are too
large to be completely loaded (100K of bytecode).  The solution to this problem
is that we generate one file for each interface, and lazy load the 
implementations as needed.  Considering that most applications only care about
a few mavlink packet types this seems a good solution.


# TODO before first alpha release


* Add license 
* Explain arch
  * Squirrel (modified for Nuttx)
  * Setjmp/longjmp
  * flying squirrel library - user level API for developing squirrel apps for vehicles(flsq)
  * flying squirrel adapter - the C/C++ stub which must be provided for any new autopilot library or GCS

* Fix capitalization of packet names
* Add mavlink library
* Add logging library
* Add debug library
* Make vario proof-of-concept
* Change vehicle init scripts to boot flsq if available
* For Nuttx/P4 handler
  * lower priority
  * use own heap
* For SITL handler
  * implement
* Add install instructions

# TODO eventually

* Optionally generate/check CRCs on mavlink packets
* Make the mavlink generated classes more compact, possibly create them
  completely programmatically from arrays that are passed in?
* make a loadbinary() that compiles to binary if necessary and writes the 
  compiled file to disk - to make for faster loading than compiling from src
* Delete dead actors (rather than just leaving them suspended) - MEMORY LEAK
